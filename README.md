# localLibrary 

Thinkful Project - Local Library

The neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program. This program does just that

The Program also:
- Includes implementation of functions using find(), filter(), map(), sort(), and reduce()
- Includes a Helper function called _sortByCount()
- Uses Spread operators, the ternary operator, Object Destructuring, and for/in loops
